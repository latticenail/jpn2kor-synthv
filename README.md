# JPN2KOR SynthV dictionary
Korean dictionary for Japanese SynthV voicebanks.
## How to use
The dictionary entries are romanized, although there might be future hangul input as well. *It's advised to phoneme edit accordingly rather than plug-and-play.*

For consonants like "bb", "gg", "dd", "jj", and "ss" it's recommended you increase the phoneme strength as well.

Please note this dictionary was made with AI voicebanks in mind, so it might be faulty for Standard voicebanks. (Again, I'll also consider adding support for this if needed.)

Also, credit isn't necessary, I don't really mind; but if you'd like to, feel free to link back or tag me on my socials (latticenail on Twitter and SoundCloud) so I can see what you've done ^_^
## Notes
* Alternate pronunciation for some syllables by adding 2 or 3 to the end
* Includes individual ending consonants (i.e. k, ng, l). Uppercase aliases are included too
* Includes syllables starting with "f", "v", and "z"
